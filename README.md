 LocalHelp – Community-Powered Emergency Resource Locator
🚨 A real-time, mobile-first web app to connect people in need with community-sourced help during emergencies.
🧠 Problem It Solves
In times of crisis—such as floods, power outages, pandemics, or health emergencies—people often struggle to access basic necessities like:

Drinking water

Medical aid

Safe shelters

Free food and essentials

There is no centralized platform for real-time, community-sourced help, especially in rural or underserved regions.

✅ Solution: "LocalHelp"
A lightweight, mobile-friendly web app that allows users to:

✅ Post available help (food, shelter, medicines, volunteers) with their location

✅ Find help nearby using current location or manual search

✅ View all help resources on an interactive map

✅ Mark help as received or expired to keep listings up-to-date

✅ Work offline using localStorage and auto-sync when reconnected

🔧 Core Features
Feature	Description
Add Help Resource	Users can submit help listings via a simple form with title, type, location
Search Help Nearby	Filter by distance, type (e.g. food, medicine), or keywords
Interactive Map View	Map (Google Maps or Leaflet) with dynamic help resource pins
Status Tracking	Mark resources as "Resolved" or "Expired"
Offline Mode	Store data in localStorage if offline; syncs when online
Mobile-First Design	Optimized for field use on phones

🛠️ Technologies Used
✅ HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript

✅ Google Maps API or Leaflet.js

✅ Geolocation API

✅ LocalStorage for persistence

✅ Optional Firebase or IndexedDB (for offline-first experience)

✅ Modular, reusable code structure

🌍 Real-World Use Cases

🧠 Why This Project Stands Out
🚫 Not a tutorial clone

💡 Solves a grassroots problem with a practical, user-first approach

🛠️ Showcases product thinking and frontend skills

📈 Easily scalable into a real-world product

🚀 Project Roadmap (MVP)
📄 Part 1: UI for Add & View Help
